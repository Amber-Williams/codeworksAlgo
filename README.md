Good evening Ladies & Gentlemen,

### SITUATION:
A bunch of strings have called and desperately want to know all of their possible permutations.

### MISSION:
Your mission is to help determine all possible permutations of these strings and report back in the form of an array. Eg. resulting output of ['ab', 'ba'] in the case of the string 'ba'. Keep in mind that if there are duplicates you will fail your mission.

### EXECUTION:
You have 15 minutes to successfully execute your mission.

## ACTIONS:
Make sure you fork the repo and run npm i in the directory.

## COMMAND:
Good luck.
